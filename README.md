# CandyCrushGame_C
Algorithm implementation of candy crush game using C programming.

In this C program, the algorithm implementation of a Candy crush game using six by six matrix had been done successfully. I designed the algorithm on my own. I don't know whether it is the fastest algorithm. But it is a working algorithm. 

For selecting an element , I get the input as row, column to pick element. For moving it in possible four direction, I used wasd keys. 'W' for upward swipe. 'A' for leftward swipe. 'S' for downward swipe. 'D' for rightward swipe. You could make upto six combo of same gems in a row or column or both. You could see the score updating for each crushes. Here I implemented only four types of gems with numbers zero to three. You could play upto many levels as per your wish. Do run the C program.
